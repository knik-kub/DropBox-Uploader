DropBox-Uploader
================

Upload Files to DropBox with only JavaScript and HTML 5

This is based on the work of Dave Mello who wrote a previous dropbox uploader that can be found here:

and Eric Bidelman who wrote an HTML5 file uploader that can be found here:
http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/

Both gentleman wrote very nice tutorials.  Read them.

To use this demo you will need to set up a Dropbox app with a developers account and add the app key on line 86 of reader.js. Enjoy.
